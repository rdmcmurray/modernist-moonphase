# modernist-moonphase
 A moonphase complication for the Adafruit MagTag. Customization instructions are commented in code.py. Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@paarhaas](https://twitter.com/paarhaas) if you have any questions.
 
 ##Requirements
 1. An Adafruit IO account key (free) to fetch the timezone (you could use some other http request if you prefer)
 2. Adafruit Image Load Library, available as a part of the CircuitPython Library bundle: <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>

##Limitations
The image file(s) are quite large. I haven't yet investigated drawing shapes, but you probably won't be able to run much else on your MagTag.
